5 features
1. Emmet Abbreviations-These useful shortcuts come built-in to VS Code, and they make writing HTML (and CSS) a lot faster.
2. The Integrated CLI (Command Line Interface)-To save switching between windows, VS Code offers an integrated terminal or CLI. Simply, press CNTRL + ' or CMD + ' to open it up, and the same command to close it. It will automatically open in the directory you have open in VS Code, which saves the navigation step required for operations in a standard terminal.
This makes it easy to install NPM or Yarn dependencies, commit files to Git, and push files to Github — as well as anything else you might want

3. ESLint-ESLint is a powerful and popular linting tool, which helps you spot errors in your code and fix them as you write and which helps you follow common best-practices. It’s also a great learning tool, since researching ESLint errors has taught me many best practices I didn’t know before, and it’s helped me understand why they are best practices.
You can add it as a node package on a per-project basis or you can use the ESLint extension within VS Code. The second option is quick and easy, and it won’t stop you using unique ESLint configurations for particular projects later on. Simply find the ESLint plugin (the one by Dirk Baeumer) and install it.
4.  Visual Studio Code CLI-Visual Studio Code comes with an inbuilt Command Line Interface. Once you've installed Visual Studio Code, and have it open, press ⇧⌘P to open the command palette for Mac, or just ⌘P and the press > button.
5.  Live Share-Visual Studio Code Live Share is a feature that enables you to share your VS Code instance, and allow someone remote to control and run other things such as debuggers.

Live Share is published as a plugin, and is currently in Preview.
